# Module Vector4



This class represents a vector in 4D or projective space


## Functions

### create(x, y, z)

Creates a new `Vector4` *    * 
| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
|  **x**  | The x component ||  **y**  | The y component ||  **z**  | The z component |


**Returns:** A new instance of `Vector4`






## Operators

The class supports the following operators:

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| operator + | Sums two vectors |
| operator - | Subtracts two vectors |
| operator * | Scalar product |
| operator / | Scalar division |
| operator # | Returns the vector&#39;s magnitude |
| operator unary - | Returns a negated copy of this vector |
| operator [] | Allows access of the components of this vector by numeric index |
| operator [] = | Allows setting the components of this vector by numeric index |
| operator &lt;&gt; | Compares two vectors returning 0 if they match exactly or the difference of their magnitude otherwise. |
| operator ^ | Dot product |
